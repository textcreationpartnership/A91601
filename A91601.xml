            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>1. Whether a King be ordained of God for the welfare of the people, or the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple appointed ſubjects to the King for the honour and pleaſure of a King.</head>
                  <p>THis muſt needs be reſolved that the King is inſtituted of God by his divine Ordinance, but by ſubordinate meanes of the people their firſt and primary Election, or by their approbation of his prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Title or allowed merits, wherein though it be an hereditary or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive right of a Crowne; Yet is that inheritance or ſucceſſion either originally and immediately given, or ſubſequently and mediately appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and allowed to him and his poſterity by the people: And by and with the meanes of the Lawes, Cuſtomes, or Conſttutions of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof he becometh the head and Governor. To the end that hee may and ſhall Rule, guide and governe and protect the people under his charge and care in the true worſhip and ſervice of God, with love and faithfulneſſe, and with ſuch tenderneſſe as a Lord and Maſter ought to uſe toward his family, a ſhepheard towards his flocke, and a father to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his deare beloved children. Not that he ſhould in any wiſe like a domineering Maſter cruelly beate and evill intreat his ſervants, or an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (no true) ſhepheard, neglect or peele his flocke; or be careleſſe of their protection and fafety from ravening Woolves, and biting Curres. Nor as an unnaturall and hard hearted father, grieve and afflict his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with overmuch chaſtiſement, or give them ſtones inſtead of bread. And although it cannot be denied that the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the holy Prophets of their time by the immediate appointment of God their proper King and heavenly father, who miraculouſly ruled, guided and protected them from the beginning before they had any earthly King like other Nations: Yet when they deſired a King (like as other Nations had) the Lord then told them what ſuch Kings did and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111115:2"/> would take upon them and uſe to do. Not that God did appoint or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne or allow them ſo to do; for God did not tell any King by the mouth of his Prophets, that hee would give him a people to uſe at his pleaſure, but he granted the people a King to guide and command them as he <hi>Moſes</hi> long before. And when <hi>Saul</hi> their firſt King was choſen (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the talleſt man among the people) and annoynted by the Prophet to be King over <hi>Iſrael</hi> (which height of ſtature did onely note that the people ſhould remarke the height of his dignity when he was ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them) The declaration of Gods divine grace and holy Spirit infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the word of the Prophet made him fit and worthy to Rule (yea even to prophecy among the Prophets) and ſo was he accepted by the Acclamation of the people. For no ſooner that Divine Spirit of grace had left him, but he became an Apoſtate from God, and his religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of well governing as a King; and was thenceforth relict of God, and neither the haughtineſſe of his ſtature, nor the dignity of his Throne availed him any longer; but the youngeſt and leaſt of <hi>Iſhai</hi> his ſonnes was choſen from the ſheepfoldes to be King and to Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne Gods people, which after his annoyntment by the Prophet and the time of his exaltation to the Crowne, he governed with a faithfull and true heart, and ruled them prudently with all his power. And in after ages the Chronicles of the Kings doe ſhew how often the good Kings that maintained the true Worſhip of God did long continue in their States and Thrones and flouriſht, but ſuch as were evill, and ſet up Idols and hill Altars, and cauſed or ſuffered the people to ſinne againſt their God, God did rend and divide and utterly take away their Kingdomes from them. Onely it is ſpecially remarkable of the good King <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> who had ſlipped and erred, but repented and recollected himſelfe, that the mercifull God quickly heard his prayers and ſaw his teares, and added to his daies and happy Raigne fifteene yeares; which number if it be added to our good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> his Raigne will exceed the time of many of his progenitors. But God may pleaſe to adde fifty in ſteed of fifteene, and then the yeares both of his life and Raigne will exceed all his noble progenitors.</p>
                  <p>The like is to be obſerved of Chriſtian Kings and Emperours after but Saviour his Incarnation, and that the Chriſtian faith was eſtabliſhed; they had their Annoyntment from God by the hand of the Biſhops, but their acceptance was by the people. And it is manifeſt that both the ancient Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> before the Incarnation of our Saviour, as alſo all Chriſtian Kings ſince were bound by Oath taken, or by Royall obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Rule and Raigne by and according to the Lawes of the Land.

Jus perſonarum, rerum &amp; actionum,</hi> of every man, whereof the firſt is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely preſerved by the great Charter of <hi>England, Nullus liber homo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietur, impriſonetur, &amp;c.</hi> The ſecond is ſecured to every man, by the Law of property, wherein it is ſaid, <hi>Quod noſtrum eſt, ſine furte aut aſſenſu no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro a nobis tolli non poteſt,</hi> upon which no Regall power or Prerogative can trench. And the third, both by the words of the great Charter, <hi>Nulli negabimus, &amp;c. juſtitiam,</hi> and by the Statute Ordaining that every man ſhould enjoy the benefit of Law, and Courts of Juſtice for his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Lands, Goods or Chattels. And that neither the great Seale, nor Privy Seale, ſhould hinder the due courſe of Law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in point of diſtributive Juſtice, either in <hi>paena</hi> or <hi>praemio,</hi> for good or evill behaviour in the publique converſation or actions of one towards another. And in this part of Common Law of the Land, <hi>Malum in ſe</hi> is moſt concerned, that vice ſhould be puniſhed, and ought not to be ſpared by any Regall power, leave, or licence in any caſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, for it were improper that the King (being Gods Vicegerent) might or ever ſhould connive at, or leave unpuniſhed, any crime or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, contrary to the Commandements of God, or the Law of Nature.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111115:4"/> For his Majeſty is ſaid to be like God, <hi>Dixi Dii eſtis,</hi> and the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſay, <hi>Deus non poteſt ma um agere quia non vult, &amp; non vult, quod non poteſt:</hi> according to which the Lawyers ſay, <hi>Id poſſumus quod de jure poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumus,</hi> and that <hi>Le Rey ne poit faire tort.</hi> And for the <hi>malum prohibitum,</hi> by Statutes or Ordinances of Parliament, his Majeſty cannot, nor will goe againſt them, but in <hi>Tutiorem partem,</hi> to pardon where there is hope of amendment. Otherwiſe ſee the Statute of <hi>Northampton,</hi> wherein ſome odious crimes are denyed the King to pardon. Wherefore ſo it is, that if the King, through that naturall propenſity of Kings (ſpoken of by God himſelf) doe more then he ſhould doe toward the people, or that by his omiſſion ſome enormities are crept in, then it behoveth him to call together his great Councell in Parliament, to adviſe with them for his owne better direction, and for Reformation of abuſes, and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of ſuch as have abuſed and miſled his Majeſty, whereupon the fourth Queſtion enſueth.</p>

                  <head>The Fourth Question.</head>
                  <head>4. What Power or priviledge the High Court of Parliament hath, when they are aſſembled together; and are become the Repreſentative Body of the Kingdome?</head>
                  <p>IT is Reſolved, that they, with the Kings aſſent, may, as cauſe ſhall require, make new Lawes, or abrogate any former Statutes; But the maine Common Law, and the Ancient Rites, Uſages, and Native Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the Land, they themſelves cannot alter. For (as the Lawyers phraſe is to ſay) it is <hi>Oppoſitum in objecto,</hi> that they that ſit by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lawes, and by the ancient Rites, Uſages and Cuſtomes of the Land, ſhould alter and change that which gave them their Authority to be a Repreſentative Body.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the two Houſes of Peeres and Commons <hi>Rege abſente &amp; non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiente,</hi> may declare the Common Law in Caſes where doubt is, or ambiguity or difficulty, but they can make no Law without the King, to ſtand as a Law and Statute. Onely they can make temporary Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Parliament, like Orders or Sentences interlocutory, <hi>ſendente Paerliamento,</hi> and they may cenſure and puniſh delinquents.</p>
                  <p>But in caſe the King will not call a Parliament, as in <hi>Richard</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond his time, when the urgent occaſions of the Common-wealth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it; the Peeres called the Parliament. Then the Peeres and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons can doe all things as a compleat Parliament without the King. And at this time the Kings Majeſty having called a Parliament, and ſo ſarre proceeded as he hath done already, in making ſome good and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111115:4"/> wholeſome Lawes for Reformation of the greateſt errors and abuſes that ever were in this Common-wealth. And eſpecially having condeſcended to a Trienniall Parliament to be for ever hereafter, and neither this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Parliament, nor any Parliament hereafter aſſembled, to be diſſolved without the conſent of both Houſes: Yet now his Majeſty being ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by evill inſtruments, doth diſſever himſelfe from his Parliament, and by his abſence, doth (as they ſay) hinder their proceedings, to the making of good and wholeſome Lawes, for the kingdome and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.

                     </gap> this Caſe may be done, is not to be reſolved by any wit or judgment, but by the abſolute Wiſedome and Authority of that high Court, conſiſting of both Houſes, to whom in all humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the Writer hereof leaveth it.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe, with the like humility and awfull feare of offence againſt the Publique, and with a faithfull zeale to the Common-wealth, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth theſe conſiderations, ſcrutative of the matter or cauſe of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riances betweene his Majeſty and his great Councell of Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is the very true cauſe of his Majeſties abſence, and ſeverance from his Parliament ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> whither they were firſt ſummoned, and which is the moſt convenient place of their aſſembly and fitting?</p>
                  <p>The King alledgeth that it was the tumultuous riot of the diſordered <hi>Londoners,</hi> raſh and young Prentices, and of furious and fanaticke Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, Anabaptiſts, and Sectaries of the City and Suburbes, pretending to cry out againſt Biſhops, but intending and offering affront and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty to his Majeſty, his Regall authority, whereby his royall Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was indangered at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> had he not had a Guard about him, and ſo his Majeſty ſaith, they were like to doe againe, if he were at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Parliament ſaith, it was a malignant party of Cavalieres, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not well affected to peace, and enemies to the Common-wealth, who by flattery and falſe in ſinuations did diſſwade his Majeſty from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with the grave adviſe of his great Councell. And the Papiſts, and papall affected Biſhops, dreading that their plots were diſcovered, and like to be prevented, and the delinquents puniſhed by the more ſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Lawes or Orders of the Parliament, did incite his Majeſty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in that ill adviſed Courſe.</p>
                  <p>And further, that ſuch the malignant party ſeducing his Majeſty, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured to bring in imperiall power and Arbitrary rule for his Majeſty to over-rule the Lawes, and ancient Uſages, and Cuſtomes of <hi>England,</hi> and the priviledges of Parliament, and abridge the liberty and property of the Subjects. The evidence whereof hath beene partly ſhewne forth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111115:5"/> by ſome Declarations divulged, and Printed by Order of both Houſes of Parliament, expreſſing the precedent attempts of foraine force, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticke, and coercive power of Armes, which late before the Parliament, was plotted and put in way of conſtraint upon the Common-wealth. And that moved the Parliament to crave and aſſume to themſelves the <hi>Militia</hi> at home, for the ſecuring of the Coaſts of the Sea, and of guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and fortifying the Ports and other places at Land. That though his Majeſty were ſeduced and miſled by the malignant party, and their Complices; Yet his Royall Perſon, Crowne and Dignity, ſhould be preſerved in peace and ſafety, and the Common-wealth and people ſhould be defended and kept in peace and proſperity, maugre the devilliſh plots abroad, and within the bowels of the Land, by Papiſts, Prieſts, papall Biſhops, bloody and rapinous military men, Captaines, and Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, whoſe diſpoſition was, and is properly bent to warre and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and to rapine and ſpoile, and to make their prey on the wealth of the rich Citizens and other the quiet people of the Land.</p>
                  <p>The King contrariwiſe taking high diſpleaſure at that part or point of the Parliaments Demand for, and touching the <hi>Militia,</hi> Alledged that the right of <hi>Militia,</hi> or Command of Armes within the Land, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth properly to his Regality, and as a Flower of his Crowne, not to be aſſayed, or attempted by any Subject, no not the High Court of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, though they be the Repreſentative body of the people, no more then it could be lawfull for the people themſelves to riſe and take Armes againſt their Soveraigne King.</p>
                  <p>Wherein, as by ſome Written and Printed diſcourſe or Declaration, It hath beene already avowed, and maintained, that the <hi>Militia</hi> was not improperly deſired of and from his Majeſty, nor unlawfully aſſumed by them for a certaine convenient time. They perceiving more then the King or people doe know of the imminent danger both of his Royall Perſon, Crowne and dignity, and to the priviledges of Parliament, and to the Lawes of the Land, and Liberties of the People like to beene ſubverted, and moſt eſpecially the whole honour and true worſhip of God, and true Proteſtant Religion to be overthrowne, may and will, by and through Gods grace and aſſiſtance, prevent and pervert or quell and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the evill and wicked attempts of all the malignant oppoſites. It is therefore by all true and ſound reaſon of all Lawes, Divine Lawes of Nature and Nations, Civill policy, and the Provinciall Rites, Uſages, and Cuſtome, which are the Lawes of his Land, reſolved that the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiai</hi> to be diſtinguiſht of, and the point defined and determined thus, <hi>viz</hi> The King of this Land no leſſe, but as much, and as amply as any
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:111115:5"/> other Foraine Chriſtian King hath in himſelfe, and pertaining to his Regalty, Crowne, and Dignity, the <hi>Jus Militiae,</hi> at all times to uſe, and to lead and to command by his Lieutenant, the Generall and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, for the ſafety and peace of his Land and people, againſt any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine foes, or domeſticke trayterous enemies: But this is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, when his Majeſty, with his owne proſpective eye, and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or by the advice of his Privy Councell, before Parliament or great Councell in Parliament, hath or doth diſcover the Plots or purpoſes of foraine enemies intending miſchiefe, aſſault or ruine, by Invaſion foraine, or of domeſticke traytors, by Inſurrection and Rebellion at home.</p>
                  <p>For in truth it is a Flower of the Kings Crowne, and an incident of his Regality, (as he is a King) to have <hi>Liberam &amp; abſolutam poteſtatem,</hi> or, <hi>Jus Bellum indicendi &amp; gerendi,</hi> to or againſt any Foraine Prince or Potentate; and againe, <hi>Jus &amp; poteſtatem pacis contrahendae &amp; paciſcendae,</hi> with any of them: and thus all the learned Authours, writing of Law and Policy, by the Titles of their Bookes <hi>de lege Regia,</hi> have averred, and maintained, and it is not to be denyed, becauſe the King is the head of the body politique; which compared to the naturall body, wherein the five ſenſes are operative, and doe their Offices by their <hi>Organa rite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſita,</hi> yet the naturaliſts doe affirme, that the <hi>Communis ſenſus</hi> is in the braine, or in <hi>Occipite,</hi> and that <hi>per diſcurſum practicum,</hi> it judgeth and reſolveth of the other ſenſes, their pleaſing or being uſefull and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the whole body, or offending and annoying it: And ſo the King hath the <hi>Jus militiae,</hi> or power and command of Armes at home, throughout his kingdome, for he hath <hi>Poteſtatem vitae &amp; necis,</hi> as the <hi>Civilians</hi> terme it. And in our Law, the death of any is to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for to the King, and the taking away of any Liege Subjects life, is in the Indictment ſaid to be <hi>Contra Coronam &amp; dignitatem Regis.</hi> But all this notwithſtanding the generall poſition of the <hi>Jus Principis,</hi> or <hi>Lex Regia,</hi> placing the power of Armes and <hi>Militia,</hi> in the Crowne, yet his Majeſty cannot otherwiſe levy the <hi>Militia,</hi> but by lawfull meanes, and not by Commiſſion of Array, as lately hath beene, for that is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due charge, not warranted by Law. And in caſe of particular accidents that the King the Head, be miſ-informed of his and the Common-wealths enemies, conceiving them to be friends which are ſecret and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate adverſaries, complotting clandeſtine Ruine and deſtruction to the body, and refuſe to afford ayde for the prevention of imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; will any judicious man doubt but the eyes of the body, being the great Councell of Common-wealth, diſcerning the miſchiefe and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, doe well and providently, if they call the Armes and Hands to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:111115:6"/> ſtrike and fight, the Loynes to joyne in ſtrength, and Legges and Feet; to goe and runne to helpe to defend the Totall, that ſo the Head being diſquieted with ache and paines, may be preſerved in reſt, and quiet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore in ſuch caſe as now it is here in <hi>England,</hi> the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body hath, and in all Reaſon, <hi>Proſalute Regis &amp; Populi,</hi> ought to have and to uſe, and command the <hi>Militia,</hi> throughout the Land, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as the King be better informed, and the Common-wealth and Body be ſetled againe in peace and ſafety, and that then ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Law concerning the <hi>Mi itia,</hi> be made for time to come, to prevent ſuch like accidents as this hath beene.</p>
                  <p>And hereupon it may be conſidered, whether the two Houſes of Peeres and Commons, had not cauſe to demand the approbation of ſome Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of State. The <hi>Militia</hi> not conſiſting meerely in the having of Armes, but alſo in the power of force to defend againſt Invaſion, or the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of an Enemy, wherein if ſuch Officers as ſhould be intruſted with the power and force of the Armes, and with the cuſtody of the Forts, and other places of ſtrength within the kingdome, ſhould not be well and truely affected to the government of this Land: How eaſily may it be perceived, thoſe ſtrong holds, which already are, or at leaſt are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the wiſedome of the Parliament, ſhortly to be fortifyed for the greateſt defence, will or may become the greateſt offence, and thoſe Bands of Military Forces, which are ſuppoſed to be for the ſafeguard of the kingdome, turne to the Ruine and Deſtruction of the Common-wealth?</p>
                  <p>Theſe then being the true and genuine cauſes or motives of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeverances betweene the King and Parliament, whereat all true hearts have grieved; What preſumption ſhall it be deemed in a true <hi>Engliſh</hi> heart, bleeding with compaſſionate ſorrow, for the head and body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique ſo miſerably indangered of utter perdition, by unnaturall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill broyles, which <hi>Lucan</hi> writing of, lamenteth and deſcribeth in theſe words and lines,

                  </p>
                  <p>If I ſay, ſuch a true hearted <hi>Engliſh man,</hi> doe propoſe theſe Soveraigne Salves for ſo deadly a ſore, and theſe preſent Remedies for ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a ſickneſſe, to prevent the inſtant death and deſolation of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and renowned kingdome and Nation, whoſe people were of old
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:111115:6"/> time ſurnamed <hi>Angli quaſi Angeli,</hi> or <hi>ab Angulo dicti,</hi> as being in an angle or corner of the world, and ſevered from the reſt, according to that of the Poet, <hi>Et penitus toto diviſos orbe Britannos;</hi> And which ſome Divines terme one of the beloved Iſles of the Gentiles, wherein the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell of Chriſt was ſoonely Preached after his Aſcenſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt then may it pleaſe his moſt Excellent Majeſtie piouſly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly to turne his Royall Heart and gracious affection toward his great Councell of Parliament, who doe repreſent all his deare people, and be adviſed by them, no more to reſpect or give eare to thoſe Syrene hallucinations of flattering ſeducers, the Papiſts and Jeſuite Prieſts, the Papally inclined Biſhops, who ſtand ſo much for their <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> as that they with <hi>Demas</hi> have forſaken the purity of the Goſpell, and neglect the Preaching of the holy Word of God, and have imbraced this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World, making themſelves Lords over Gods Heritage, not true Shepherds to feed his flocke, as they ought to doe, in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon, and to waite upon the All-ſeeing eye of Gods providence for his beloved Spouſe the Church, to be purged and cleanſed of her late inbred and inbrought corruptions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, that his Majeſty will abandon and quite put away the thought or imagination of any Tyrannicall or <hi>Imperiall</hi> Government o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this Land, which the Papall Biſhops and Hierarchicall Prelates and Prieſts, and other Lay Flatterers, did preſume to uſe daily, and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate and inculcate to his Sacred Eares, under the pretence of telling his Majeſty, that he is an abſolute Imperiall Monarch, free and above, and without all Lawes, to Rule his people <hi>ad Arbitrium Principis,</hi> and that he being Gods Anoynted is reſponſall onely to God, if he doe tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize or grieve his Subjects; Whereas they are or make themſelves utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of the true State and quality of the kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> after the old triple diſtinction of Empire, written by <hi>Bartolus</hi> and <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> the beſt Civilian Doctors, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is <hi>Imperium merum,</hi> and <hi>Imperium mixtum cum Juriſdictione,</hi> and that in ſome places there is onely <hi>Juriſdictio ſine imperio,</hi> as is the ſtate of the Low Countries, and other Ariſtocraticall and Democraticall Governments: whereof the firſt, <hi>i.e. Merum Imperium,</hi> was the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire gotten meerely by the ſword, and for the moſt part kept by the ſword, according to the ſaying of <hi>Juſtin</hi> the Hiſtorian, in the beginning of his Booke, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium iiſdem modis tenetur quibus paratur.</hi> And by that Empire, <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis placitum legis babet vigorem.</hi> As <hi>Juſtinian</hi> in the firſt of his Inſtitutes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:111115:7"/> mentioneth. The ſecond, <hi>i.e. Mixtum Imperium cum juriſdictione,</hi> is the Crowne or Kingly power of <hi>England,</hi> Monarchichall indeed; for <hi>Rex in ſolio</hi> is <hi>ſine paci;</hi> But in <hi>Parliamento</hi> or <hi>Concilio regendi,</hi> he hath <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Regni, i.e.</hi> Peeres, ſo dignifyed by him, and honoured from the Fountaine of his Majeſties Honour. And he hath alſo the <hi>Communita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Populi,</hi> which the bleſſed, and ever proſperous Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>ſibi precioſiſſimam.</hi> And all theſe three States of <hi>King, Peeres,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> were happily Conjunct and preſerved together, by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments of the ancient Lawes of the Land, and Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which Lawes and Priviledges were never ſubjugated by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; but ever over-lived the change of Kings, and appeaſed force, and induced Kings into their ſetled Reignes here. According as that learned Chiefe Juſtice, Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> was bold in preſence to tell his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, the late King <hi>James,</hi> of famous memory, That the Law ſet the Crowne upon his head. Whereat his Majeſty ſeemed angry, but was ſo prudent and wiſe, as not to be ſo. And the old learned <hi>Bracton,</hi> that wrote like, as he was, a ſtudyed Civilian, as well as a Judge of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, in King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond his time, adviſeth every King of this Land in theſe words, <hi>Id tribuat Rex Legi, quod Lex attribuit ei.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which two maine points or Principles in this preſent ſtate of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that is to ſay, the Church Government eſtabliſhed with the true Proteſtant faith and Religion, and the free Regall power, qualifyed with the Naturall and Nationall Lawes of this Land, the untouched Priviledges of Parliament, and the Rites and Liberties of the people, being not onely Cordially profeſſed, and proteſted by his Majeſty, but ſecured by the high wiſedome, and care of the Peeres and Commons, and his Majeſty joyouſly returning to his beloved Parliament.</p>
                  <p>May it pleaſe the Almighty God of his infinite goodneſſe, ſo to inſpire both King, and Peeres, and Commons, with his Divine grace, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and Diſſolution of Church Government be avoyded and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by due reſtraint, and correction of all Sectaries and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, &amp;c. Who in truth, if they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their fanaticke intents, would have no King at all over them on Earth, nor Church, or materiall Churches; But in rapture of the Spirit would fly up to Heaven for the <hi>Judaicke King,</hi> and in the meane time would hold their Church and Conventicles in the Aire, or Woods or Barnes, or Stables, or in their owne holy breaſts, whereas though Chriſt himſelfe ſaid his kingdome was not of this world, yet he taught his Diſciples, that in this world they ſhould obey Kings, as of Gods
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:111115:7"/> ordinance, and be tributary to them. <hi>Date Caeſari quae ſunt Caeſaris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that no conceit of any popular or plebeian ſway in this Land, be in any true <hi>Engliſh</hi> heart: But that the Members of both Houſes may ſo prepare good and wholeſome Lawes for the Church, as may quite extirpate Popery, and prevent Schiſmes, and all rendings or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Chriſt, his ſeameleſſe garment of unity of the Spirit, to be faſt girt with the bond of Peace. And for the Common-wealth that never hereafter there be any more Inrodes upon the Lawes, priviledges, or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of free <hi>Engliſh</hi> men.</p>
                  <p>That finally God may be truely honoured, and purely ſerved and worſhipped, his holy Word rightly diſpenſed, and his Sacraments duely and decently adminiſtred; And then his Heavenly bleſſings will undoubtedly ſhowre downe upon this little Iſle of Great <hi>Britaine,</hi> and the words and wiſhes of an Ingenious Votary may be fulfilled.

               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <p>1.

                  <p>Theſe muſt know their error and ignorance in their Tenets of Kingly power and government within this Realme, and be told by Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> if he were living, that never any man in <hi>England</hi> kicked his heele a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lawes of the Land, but in fine the Law brake his necke; and let theſe Hierarchical Biſhops be corrected of their ſuperbity, and reformed in their ſuperiority and domination in the Church and their worldly mindedneſſe in Country and Commonwealth, as pleaſe the King and Parliament.</p>
